# Simple Lastpass Workflow for Alfred

Simple yet powerful integration with the Lastpass CLI so you can now get your passwords out of your Lastpass vault and straight into the clipboard from within Alfred.

## How to use the workflow
Check out the official YouTube video, it will give you a quick two and a half minute rundown (updated for v1.2 and above).

## Donations
This workflow represents many many hours effort of development, testing and rework. The images licensed for this workflow from [DepositPhotos](http://depositphotos.com?ref=1682540) also needed a bit of my moolah. So if you love the workflow, and get use out of it every day, if you would like to donate as a thank you to buy me more caffeine giving Diet Coke, some Cake, or to put towards a shiny new gadget you can [donate to me via Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=JM6E65M2GLXHE).
